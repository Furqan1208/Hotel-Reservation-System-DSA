# Hotel-Reservation-System-DSA
A hotel reservation system using linked lists, developed as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. The system includes user authentication, dynamic room availability, and Quick Sort for sorting room prices. It demonstrates practical DSA concepts like linked lists, file handling, and sorting algorithms in a real-world context.

# Hotel Reservation System using Linked List

## Overview
This project is a Hotel Reservation System that efficiently manages bookings using linked lists. It features user registration, login, room reservation, and admin tools. Developed for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course, the project applies linked lists, Quick Sort, and file handling to create a functional and efficient reservation system.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and admin access.
- **Room Reservation**: Dynamic booking management with linked lists.
- **Sorting**: Rooms sorted by price using Quick Sort.
- **Account Management**: Users can update their account information.
- **File Handling**: Persistent storage of user and reservation data.

## DSA Concepts
- **Linked Lists**: Core data structure for managing reservations.
- **Quick Sort**: Used for sorting room prices.
- **File Handling**: Ensures data persistence and security.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Furqan1208/Hotel-Reservation-System-LinkedList.git
